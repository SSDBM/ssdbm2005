        *Note that the barbeque will be held on the beach.  Weather on the coast
        is variable and sometimes includes fog and wind which makes it cold 
        (50-65&deg; F (10-18&deg; C)).
        A warm coat is recommended for the beach barbeque and any other outdoor
        excursion.  Meals at Bren will all be outside.
