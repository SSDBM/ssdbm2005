        Santa Barbara is a community of about 90,000 people located in the
        middle of the Southern California Bight, a section of south facing
        coastline bordered by Point Conception to the west and the town of
        Carpenteria to the east.  Santa Barbara offers world class coastal hotels,
        dining and recreation.  Recreation opportunities includes swimming,
        hiking, birding, surfing, mountain biking, rock climbing, sea kayaking,
        wine tasting, diving and boating.  The Santa Barbara Channel Islands, including
        <a href="http://www.nps.gov/chis/" target="_blank">Channel Islands
        National Park</a>, are just a short boat ride across the channel where you
        can have the opportunity to experience coastal Southern California as it was
        150 years ago.
